Description


TODO:
- gethostbyname deprecated, use other to get ipv6 : addrinfo, do we do it now?
- reunite all preprocessing things in common .h for client and server, no more redundance
- can we use recv/send or forced to use read/write readline...etc?
- do we do: "do while" loop security for recv/send or read/write ?


- do we fragment all into modular functions? or put a note about it in the comments ok
- find a name for the project chat
